## Project Description

### Target Outcome and Features

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and balance the consumer disputes in the Consumer Complaints dataset. 

#### Feature Columns:
- **Date received**: The date when the complaint was received.
- **Date sent to company**: The date when the complaint was sent to the company.
- **Consumer complaint narrative**: Text describing the complaint.
- **Product**: The type of financial product involved in the complaint.
- **Time taken for response (hours)**: Calculated as the difference between the date sent to the company and the date received.
- **Consumer Disputed**: Boolean flag indicating whether the complaint was disputed.
- **Complaint Length**: The length of the consumer complaint narrative.

### Initial Feature Engineering Plan

- **Boolean Flag for Disputed Complaints**: This feature will be created to simplify the classification task.
- **Length of Complaint Narrative**: This feature will be useful for text analysis and could correlate with whether a dispute occurs.
- **Time Taken for Response**: This will help analyze the impact of response time on the likelihood of a dispute.

### Approach to Handling Imbalanced Data

Given that consumer disputes are likely to be imbalanced (e.g., a lower percentage of disputes compared to non-disputed complaints), we plan to implement the following strategies to address this imbalance:

- **Oversampling**: We will use the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create synthetic samples for the minority class (disputed complaints). This method will help us balance the dataset by generating new instances of the disputed complaints.
  

This approach aims to ensure that our predictive model is robust and capable of accurately identifying disputed complaints, ultimately leading to better insights and solutions for addressing consumer issues.
